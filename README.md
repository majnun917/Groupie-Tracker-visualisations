## Algorithm

The program's algorithm follow several key steps: 
1. <b>Fetch data via API:</b> It sends HTTP requests to fetch data from the four parts of the API (artists, venues, dates, relationships) and then decodes the received JSON responses and transforms them into usable Go data structures.
2. <b>Data Display:</b> Uses HTML templates to display information about artists, concerts, and other details which are then implemented as visualization elements such as tables, lists, maps, or charts to make the data more accessible and understandable.
3. <b>Error Handling:</b> Verify that data received from the API is valid before using it.
